National Democratic Alliance (NDA) nominee for the Presidential election Droupadi Murmu on Thursday in an emotional speech narrated her story and thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for her nomination to the highest post. ‘’Minutes before the the BJP’s parliamentary board was to declare my name, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called me to convey the party’s decision. For few moments I was speechless as I was moved by the party’s decision. I thanked the PM and other senior leaders and the party in general for giving me such an opportunity. I will make all efforts to give justice to the post after my election,’’ she said amid applause from the legislators, MPs from BJP and Shinde camp and from the union ministers and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and his deputy Devendra Fadnavis at the city’s five start hotel. Murmu, who was earlier welcomed by Shinde and Fadnavis at the airport, was later welcomed in the traditional tribal style. Highly touched by the welcome accorded by the state leaders, Murmu won the audience by starting her campaign speech in Marathi while recalling the contribution of Chhatrapati Shivaji, BR Ambedkar, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Savitribai Phule in the empowerment and welfare of the people. She made a special mention of all India BJP secretary Vinod Tawde for travelling with her across the country since day one.
